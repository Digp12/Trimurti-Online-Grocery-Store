Trimurti-Online Grocery Store
About the Project

This project is an online grocery store application built for Trimurti Kirana Stores. It helps customers shop for groceries from home, while also making it easier for the store to manage products, orders, and payments.

Customers can browse products, add them to a cart, and place an order either through online payment or cash on delivery. At the same time, the admin can handle everything from products and categories to customer orders, refunds, and reports.

The main idea is simple: make shopping easier for customers and reduce the manual work for the store.
